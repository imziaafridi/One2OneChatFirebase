# One to One Chat App with Firebase

Hi, I am student and currently learning flutter so I am practcing flutter on different task and decided to share the task with community which will give me opportunity to express my skills and open for modification or constructive feedback. I am enjoying flutter and eager to learn more to be professional in this field and try to share as much as I can. 

In this project I have learned how to do one to one chat, sending request, building UI, Logic & Firebase implementation. 

In this project I have done following things :


- Login/Registration using Firebase Authentication then storing user data in User collect on Fireabase Firestore.
- The application has two main tabs User & Chat. User tab shows all the reigster users with having one button to send request while Chat tab shows the chats of accepted user request conversation.
- Sending Request to another user and request stored in Request Collecton on Firebase Firebase Store. On Reciever side as user click on Request Icon then in seprate screen request shows with two option to accept and reject as the user accept the request then the app allow the user to chat otheriwse in case of reject request then request delete from Request collection. 
- Firebase Firestore used as database in this application with having 3 different collection user, reqeust and chat.
